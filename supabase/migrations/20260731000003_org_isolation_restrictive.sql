-- The AS RESTRICTIVE isolation floor.
-- Postgres ANDs restrictive policies with the OR-combined permissive
-- ones, so cross-tenant isolation holds even if a permissive policy — today's
-- or any future one — forgets its org predicate. This is the enforcement
-- floor; the per-domain permissive rewrites that follow are for semantic
-- correctness and readability, not for isolation.
--
-- WITH CHECK blocks both writing a row tagged into another org and
-- re-tagging an existing row's org_id.
--
-- Deliberately NO platform-admin escape hatch (`or is_platform_admin()`)
-- here: that would punch a hole through the one invariant this migration
-- exists to establish. Platform admins get their cross-org path in a later
-- migration, with its own tests.
--
-- service_role and postgres bypass RLS entirely (BYPASSRLS), so migrations,
-- seeds, and the service-role surface inventoried in
-- docs/security/service-role-inventory.md are unaffected.
--
-- One policy per org-owned table, all identical. Written out explicitly (not
-- a DO loop) so each is greppable; the schema lint asserts every org-owned
-- table has exactly one restrictive policy referencing org_id, so a table
-- added without one fails CI.
